-- # Task

-- Tables:

-- `balances`

-- | id | address | denom | amount | block_height |
-- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
-- | 1 | 0xabab.. | usdc | 50000000000000 | 733755 |
-- | 2 | 0x99cc.. | swth | -20000000 | 733757 |
-- | 3 | 0xabab.. | usdc | -50000000000 | 733855 |
-- | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

-- Each row in the `balances` table records the balance change. e.g. if address `0x99cc..` account is being deducted by `20000000swth`, it will be represented as row id=2. 

-- A denom is akin to currency.

-- `trades`

-- | id | address | denom | amount | block_height |
-- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
-- | 1 | 0xabab.. | swth | 400000000000 | 733756 |
-- | 2 | 0x99cc.. | usdc | 3500000000000 | 733757 |
-- | 3 | 0x67f3.. | swth | 72000000000000 | 733758 |
-- | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

-- Each row in the `trades` table records the trade information. e.g. if address `0x99cc..` made a trade of `3500000000000usdc`, it will be represented as row id=2.

-- Write an SQL query that returns the the list of addresses which has recently made a trade, and wallet has at least $500 (total balance) in it.

-- <aside>
-- ⚠️ Note: there may be more than one row per address in each of the `trades` and `balances` tables.
-- i.e. user made more than 1 trade, or have more than 1 change in their balance over time.

-- </aside>

-- Constraints:

-- 1. Recently made a trade means block_height strictly greater than 730000.
-- 2. There is a total of 3 denoms. 
--     1. usdc is worth $0.000001
--     2. swth is worth $0.00000005
--     3. tmz is worth $0.003
-- 3. Note that the usd values of the denoms changes frequently and we want to compute the usd value of the wallet on the fly without storing them into a table.

-- Note:

-- 1. You are recommended to use PostgreSQL because that is what we are using. However, feel free to use a language you are more familiar with.
-- 2. You’re not supposed to write a function/procedure, the solution should be entirely implemented in one query statement.



-- Here is the SQL query that should return the list of addresses 
-- which have recently made a trade and have a wallet balance of at least $500:

-- Select the addresses from the balances table
SELECT b.address
-- Join the balances and trades table on the address column
FROM balances b
JOIN trades t ON b.address = t.address
-- Filter the trades that have been made after block height 730000
WHERE t.block_height > 730000
-- Group the results by address
GROUP BY b.address
-- Calculate the total balance of each wallet by converting the denom to USD and summing the amount
HAVING SUM(CASE 
              WHEN b.denom = 'usdc' THEN b.amount * 0.000001
              WHEN b.denom = 'swth' THEN b.amount * 0.00000005
              WHEN b.denom = 'tmz' THEN b.amount * 0.003
           END) >= 500;
-- Select only the addresses whose total balance is at least $500.


-- This query joins the balances and trades tables on the address column and alters
-- the trades made after block height 730000. It then groups the results by the address column and
-- calculates the total balance of each wallet by summing the converted USD values of each balance.
-- Finally, it selects only the addresses whose total balance is at least $500.
